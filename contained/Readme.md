# Contained

A Firefox extension which automatically switches between containers when navigating to
specific domains. It improves browsing privacy by keeping your accounts separated into 
dedicated containers, and general browsing in ephemeral containers which are deleted
every few hours.

_Note_ - This extension was built primarily for my own use-case, and has no UI for
configuration. Use at your own risk!
